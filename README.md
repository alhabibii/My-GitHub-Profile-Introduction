Hi There!

I'm Adil Latif Habibi. I used to work in sales and marketing, but I am now highly interested in and eager to switch to the IT field.

Currently, I am focused on learning in the fields of data science, machine learning, and cloud computing. Although I am a beginner, I have a strong desire to learn and have taken several courses and earned certifications from well-known platforms like Datacamp, Coursera, Dicoding Academy, and AWS Re/Start.

I am proud to have earned the CCP certification from AWS Re/Start and have completed machine learning courses ranging from beginner to advanced through the Dicoding Academy scholarship. My passion for using technology and solving complex problems has driven me to pursue a career in IT.

I have completed several projects that showcase my skills and knowledge in this field. I am excited to use technology to solve real-world problems and continue to learn and improve my skills.
I invite you to take a look at my projects and connect with me as I continue my journey in the field of IT. Let's learn and grow together!
